# Nenillo-Photography

A photographer website (not actual photographer) to display my skills.

Visit the page at https://nenillophotography.netlify.app/

The purpose of this website is to display my current coding skills.
The technologies used in this project include **HTML, CSS** and **JavaScript**.

Includes a lightbox feature: when you click on an image, the full version of the image pops up. (No slideshow feature)

Photos are from **Unsplash.com**.

## What I learned

- Using a modal window.
- Implementing a Lightbox feature (image pop up).
- Using version control with Git and Github through VS Code extension. (Not terminal commands)
- Contact form doesn't send anything on purpose.
- Made a back-to-top button (works only on desktop).
